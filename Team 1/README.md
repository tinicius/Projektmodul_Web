#### 1.2.3 Product Overview (User Views)

1. **Main Dashboard:**  Upon entering, the user sees a strategic overview. This view provides a comprehensive overview of the latest AI-driven industry news and a high-level comparison between Celonis and its competitors. Integrated charts visualize key metrics, such as current stock market positioning and performance trends.

2. **News Intelligence:** Accessible via the sidebar. This section allows you to browse through all AI-generated news articles or use filters to focus on specific companies of interest.

3. **Competitor Detail Pages:**

Finally, the Competitor Pages offer deep-dive analytics for individual brands including:

- **Social & Brand Channels:** Direct links to official brand channels.

- **Financial Metrics:** Real-time stock positioning and historical price trends.

- **Positioning & Messaging:** Insights into the company’s core values, mission, and strategic messaging.

- **Targeted Intelligence:** A curated feed of AI-generated news specifically relevant to that competitor.

On top each page features a direct comparison with Celonis based on some of this data.

#### 2.2.3 WORKFLOW:

### 2.3 How to run the prototype
**Diaclaimer:**
Due to the NDA, the prototype cannot be tested with Siteco internal data.
To test the chatbot, please follow the steps below.

- add a local folder in your docker (path: /data/pdfs); there you can add your test-data for the chatbot (also see the changed "docker-compose.yml" and the folder "docker_config")
- you need a supabase credential. in your supabase project you need the tables documented in the folder "Supabase Doku" (documents, pdf_tracking and n8n_chat_histories)
- the n8n workflow needs following credentials: supabase, openai api key, a mail client of your choice
- initialize the frontend with "npm install"
- to run the frontend start it with "npm run dev"
- Additionally, the webhooks "database update" and "FAQ summary mail" can be triggered using the file "control-panel-small.html", so the automations do not have to be executed directly in n8n
