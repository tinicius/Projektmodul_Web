### 1.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT:

##### WE NEED:

#### 1.2.2 TECH STACK:

We used 3 Technologys for different purposes:
- Figma: Collaborative Tool to share insights within the Team and the client
- n8n: AI tool to collect and format data
- Webflow: Frontend Dashboard which is connected to n8n through CMS
- ChartJS: Chartbuilder Tool within Webflow Custom Code

#### 1.2.3 WORKFLOW:

The application consists of two primary views—the Dashboard and the News Page—along with dedicated detail pages for each competitor.

Upon entering the platform, you land on the Main Dashboard. This view provides a comprehensive overview of the latest AI-driven industry news and a high-level comparison between Celonis and its competitors. Integrated charts visualize key metrics, such as current stock market positioning and performance trends.

Via the side navigation bar, you can access the News Page. This section allows you to browse through all AI-generated news articles or use filters to focus on specific companies of interest.

Finally, the Competitor Pages offer deep-dive analytics for individual brands including:

- Social Media Presence: Direct links to official brand channels.

- Financial Data: Real-time stock positioning and historical price trends.

- Brand Identity: Insights into the company’s core values, mission, and strategic messaging.

- Targeted News: A curated feed of AI-generated news specifically relevant to that competitor."

On top each page features a direct comparison with Celonis based on some of this data.
